Fact_TABLE
To meet the requirements for analysis and reporting based on your data schema, you'll need to leverage the provided dimension and fact tables effectively. Here's a breakdown of how each table should be used for the specified requirements and any necessary corrections or enhancements:

### Aggregation Requirements

1. **Total Sales by Product and Store:**
   - **Fact Table:** `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Dimensions Required:** `Product_data.csv`, `store_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `Product_data.csv` on `ProductID` to get product details.
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `store_data.csv` on `StoreID` to get store details.
     - Aggregate the `Quantity` and `Price` from `Sales_data.csv` to compute total sales per product and store.

2. **Average Sales Price by Category:**
   - **Fact Table:** `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Dimensions Required:** `Product_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `Product_data.csv` on `ProductID` to get the `Category` and `Price`.
     - Calculate the average `Price` for each `Category` by aggregating the `Price` field from `Sales_data.csv`.

3. **Total Quantity Sold Per Store:**
   - **Fact Table:** `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Dimensions Required:** `store_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `store_data.csv` on `StoreID`.
     - Aggregate the `Quantity` field from `Sales_data.csv` to compute the total quantity sold per store.

4. **Customer Demographics and Purchase Patterns:**
   - **Fact Table:** `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Dimensions Required:** `customer_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `customer_data.csv` on `CustomerID`.
     - Analyze demographic information (Age, Gender, Location) from `customer_data.csv` and correlate it with purchasing patterns (such as frequency and amount spent).

### Business Use Cases

1. **Sales Optimization:**
   - **Tables Required:** `Sales_data.csv`, `Product_data.csv`, `store_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Identify high-performing products and stores by analyzing total sales and quantities.
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `Product_data.csv` and `store_data.csv` to get insights into performance metrics.
     - Develop strategies for underperforming areas by comparing sales data and identifying trends.

2. **Inventory Management:**
   - **Tables Required:** `Store_Inventory`, `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Monitor current stock levels from `Store_Inventory` and compare with sales data from `Sales_data.csv` to identify trends.
     - Calculate stock levels and sales trends to optimize inventory and prevent stockouts or overstocking.

3. **Customer Targeting:**
   - **Tables Required:** `customer_data.csv`, `Sales_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Join `Sales_data.csv` with `customer_data.csv` to analyze purchasing behavior.
     - Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing patterns to tailor marketing campaigns and promotions.

4. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - **Tables Required:** `Sales_data.csv`, `store_data.csv`
   - **Usage:**
     - Analyze store performance using sales data from `Sales_data.csv` and store details from `store_data.csv`.
     - Evaluate store performance metrics to improve operational processes and staffing based on insights derived from the analysis.

### Corrections and Enhancements

1. **Add Missing Dimension:**
   - **Inventory Details:** Thereâ€™s no explicit table for inventory history or transactions. Adding a table or dataset that tracks inventory changes over time could provide deeper insights for inventory management.

2. **Enhance Sales Detail Schema:**
   - **Date Format:** Ensure the `Date` field in `Sales_data.csv` is in a standardized format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency and ease of analysis.

3. **Account Table Enhancement:**
   - **Customer Details:** The `Accounts` table should link to `customer_data.csv` to avoid redundancy. Ensure `AccountNumber` in `Accounts` table can be matched to the `AccountNumber` in `Sales_data.csv` if customer financial details are needed for analysis.

4. **Include Additional Metrics:**
   - **Sales Trends Over Time:** Consider adding a time dimension to analyze sales trends over different periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly).

By leveraging these tables and enhancements, you can comprehensively address the aggregation and business use case requirements, providing valuable insights for decision-making and strategic planning.
